# Quick Hull

This repository contains a Java implementation of the **QuickHull** algorithm for solving the convex hull problem.

## About QuickHull

The QuickHull algorithm is a divide-and-conquer method for computing the convex hull of a set of points in a plane. It works similarly to QuickSort by recursively finding extreme points and partitioning the remaining set.
